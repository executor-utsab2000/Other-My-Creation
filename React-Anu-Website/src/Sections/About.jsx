                        It was during Durgapuja Donation collection time , we were collecting donations and as usual we went to your house .
                        We collected donation and left .  After some months as i was scrolling by instagram , <span className="text-danger fw-bold">you (now my special one❤️🫵)</span>  appeared in "People you might know" .
                        I then recalled  isn't she the one  where  we went during puja , isn't that the name . then i went to your profile saw your picture and waited for next puja . Finally that day came and we went again for donation . I confirmed yes she is the one . i searched you again in insta and followed you and messaged you <span className="text-danger fw-bold">'এই তুই আমাদের পাড়াতে থাকিস ?'</span> .The reply came from your side after a year and then i replied , provided my details and thats how we met .
                    </p>

                    <p className="mt-4">
                        First we used to chat in insta . Then a day came you said you will give me your number and then 😒😒😒🥱🥱  . Then finally after few weeks you gave me your number and we shifted from
                        instagram to whatsapp . After that i sent you friendrequest in facebook and you accepted .

                        At first we used to have less chats and calls . we continued to chat and we finally met at <span className="text-danger fw-bold">Baro Mandrir around 7pm</span>.
                        We had long chats and 8:45pm you said <i>'রাত হলো এবার বাড়ি যেতে হবে '</i>. We took a selfie and came back home walking together. You were looking too cute and your smile at our first meet ❤️❤️🫵🫵. Your eyes also , just coudn't take my eyes of you 🫵❤️🌹 .
                    </p>

                    <p className="mt-4">
                        Chats ,  calls went one and now you have become my <span className="text-danger fw-bold">पसंदीदा औरत 🌹❤️🫵</span>. Hours spend with you seems to be like seconds ,minutes of  eyes missing you seems to be like hours . After 9 to 5 jobs and a stressfull day the first person with whom I can sit and share  my day is you❤️🫵 , after a long bad day  the first one i want to see is you❤️🫵 , from small happenings to big happenings the person i want to share it with is you❤️🫵  ,  the first  one message after waking up that makes me smile is yours ❤️🫵 wish in morning .
